        <li>Divide into two prepared 8-inch round cake pans. Bake in preheated <br>oven until cake springs back when lightly touched with a fingertip and a toothpick<br> inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.<br> Cool cake layers on wire rack.</li>
        <li>To make the filling: In a saucepan, combine 2 cups chopped figs, brown<br> sugar, water and lemon juice. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook <br>until thickened, about 20 minutes. Spread thinly between cooled<br> cake layers and on top.</li>
